# Alien Invasion

Currently work in progress.

This is game from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, where you
control a spaceship that moves left and right at the bottom of the screen and
shoot aliens that invade the sky.

This project uses *Pygame*, "a collection of fun, powerful Python modules that
manage graphics, animation, and even sound, making it easier for us to build
sophisticated games."
