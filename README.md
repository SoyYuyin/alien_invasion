# Alien Invasion

This is game from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, where you
control a spaceship that moves left and right at the bottom of the screen and
shoot aliens that invade the sky.

This project uses *Pygame*, "a collection of fun, powerful Python modules that
manage graphics, animation, and even sound, making it easier for us to build
sophisticated games."

This project is developed using Object Oriented Programming. Classes share
attributes and methods across different modules to keep things organized.
